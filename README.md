Two classes, one for HRW, one for Consistent hashing. Testing functions being called in the main.

NOTE: No actual data is being stored or moved, I am simply simulating where they would go, or what would happen to the data if nodes were removed, added, etc. 

HRW:
Look at the testHRW() function for how to add more data points to test.

Consistent Hashing:
Print the different server node indexes and stored keys with print_keys_and_nodes method.

python node_ring.py is runnable.
